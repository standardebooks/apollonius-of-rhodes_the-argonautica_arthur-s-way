			<h2 epub:type="title">The Translator’s Epilogue</h2>
			<p>The historian, if asked to name the country and the period in which literary men⁠—not popular novelists, but men whose incentive to labour is the love of literature, science, research⁠—were in the most enviable position, would go very far back from the present time, and point to Egypt as the country, and the three centuries before Christ as the period. “The history of literature,” it has been said, “is hardly anything but a martyrology, as though there were a conspiracy of ingratitude among men”: but the respect, honour and support accorded to literary genius under the Ptolemies form a striking contrast to its fate in other lands and epochs.</p>
			<p>When, on the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, his vast empire was divided amongst his generals, one of them, Ptolemy Soter, became king of Egypt. Once established in his kingdom, he soon proved that he was very much more than a mere soldier. He was a man of brains, with a taste for literature, and a love for those who pursued it. His successors were worthy of him: the Ptolemies created an era in the history of literature; they made learning the fashion, and scholars, poets and men of science honourable.</p>
			<p>Ptolemy <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> (Soter) built at Alexandria a magnificent palace of learning, the Museum. This “Temple of the Muses” was such in a very literal sense, and so was very much more than a museum in the restricted sense now commonly understood. It was a Residential Royal Academy of Literature, the Resident Fellows of which were literary men. The first great annex to the Museum was a Library, which the king spared no expense to make complete, and thus he attracted scholars from all Greek-speaking countries. His successor further enlarged the library, and added galleries of pictures and statues, and commenced a natural history museum. So it went on: Ptolemy after Ptolemy added to the completeness and magnificence of the now world-famous library, and amassed wealth of art-treasures and curiosities from all parts of the world. The foundation was richly endowed, so that the poets, scholars and scientists who dwelt there lived without a care, in sheltered comfort (Timon the Phliasian satirically called it “the coop”), with every advantage for the prosecution of their labours, and (after the days of Ptolemy <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 204⁠–⁠181 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>) the prospect of a pension. There was a hall where they all dined, the king himself being sometimes of the company. Through generation after generation this institution was the hobby of the kings of Egypt, some of whom were themselves proud to be of the brotherhood of authors, and who vied with each other in fostering genius, talent and plodding industry, with a splendour, lavishness and zeal unapproached in any other age or country. It was Ptolemy <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> (Philadelphus) under whose auspices was produced the great translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, known as the Septuagint, from which the authors of the New Testament quote. When Egypt passed under the dominion of Rome, the Museum and its endowments did not suffer. Livy speaks of it as a noble monument of the wealth of the Egyptian kings; and Ammianus Marcellinus says that till the time of Aurelian (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 270⁠–⁠275), the Museum “continued to be the habitation of scholars.” The College, or Royal Society of Literature, so nobly housed, was under the government of a President, nominated first by the Ptolemies, afterwards by the Roman Emperors.</p>
			<p>Of course, patronage cannot create genius, though it can provide conditions favourable to its development; and but few men of genius appeared during this long period of the establishment and endowment of literature. But the general level of culture was raised, and the amount of literary work done was immense. A great deal of learned labour was expended upon the interpretation of Homer. “It may indeed be said,” remarks <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Prof.</abbr> Mahaffy, “that all philology among the Greeks, all textual and grammatical criticism, arose from the desire to purify and to understand the text of Homer, and then of other old poets.” At the same time, however, while nothing was more meritorious than the role of the commentator on Homer, nothing was less so than any attempt to imitate him, or to revive, in any shape or form, epic poetry. It was settled as an axiom beyond controversy that the age of great sustained poems was past, that the age of literary gem-work, of perfect finish in minute details, “of art for art’s sake,” had come to stay. So poets were to restrict themselves to “short swallow-flights of song,” fables, hymns to various deities and sacred places, elegies, epigrams, the one thing needful being that every line should be a model of polished brilliance, and that each poem should be a mine of learned allusion. Of this literary faith and practice the great champion and exponent was Callimachus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> He was, in the days of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285⁠–⁠247 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>), President of the Museum, and, in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Prof.</abbr> Murray’s words, “was perhaps the most influential personality in literature between Plato and Cicero.” Philologist, archaeologist, historian, dramatist, poet, critic⁠—there was scarcely a department of literature in which he did not, in the view of his contemporaries, excel; and his industry was enormous. As an example of the scale on which he worked, it is sufficient to mention just one of his many productions⁠—an Encyclopaedia of Literature, biographical, bibliographical and critical, in one hundred and twenty books. The prestige of his official position, coupled with his exact interpretation of the demands and capacities of his age, made him the autocrat of letters. He carved with incisive criticism, and lashed with merciless ridicule, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Thebaid</i>, an epic written by Antimachus of Colophon in imitation of Homer, a work which the Emperor Hadrian, long afterwards, pronounced superior to Homer’s⁠—from which fact we learn more perhaps of Hadrian than of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Thebaid</i>. We can faintly imagine, then, with what scornful indignation Callimachus heard that a pupil of his own, a young inmate of the Museum, who owed all his literary culture to its head, had revolted from the cardinal principles of the one literary faith, had actually written an epic!</p>
			<p>Apollonius, son of Illeus (or Silleus), born, about 270 <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, at Naucratis (or, according to other accounts, at Alexandria), was kindled by his studies in Homer to attempt a theme never yet worthily sung⁠—the story of the Quest of the Golden Fleece by heroes who were the fathers of those whose exploits Homer sang. He can hardly have been ignorant of his master’s views on the subject of modern epics; but he may well have felt some confidence that he could do that which would prove them wrong, and may have given Callimachus credit for magnanimity enough to confess himself mistaken when confronted with the actual achievement of that which he had pronounced impossible.</p>
			<p>He completed his task, and gave a public reading of his epic, probably in the lecture-hall of the Museum. Its reception was a bitter disappointment for him. The audience took its cue from the all-powerful President; and before the storm of impatient interruptions, angry disapproval and contemptuous laughter the poor lad⁠—he was not twenty⁠—broke down, “flushing crimson with mortification,” as the old Greek biographer graphically records. He recognised only too clearly who had taken the lead in crushing him, and tried to retaliate in satirical verse and stinging epigram. But it is given to few to be as effective with this weapon as Dryden or Byron, and Apollonius found that his enemy’s artillery, discharged as it was from the vantage-ground of social influence and official authority, overmatched his own. Callimachus was not ashamed to put forth all his strength against his young and friendless opponent; and his bitter satire, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Ibis</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> seems to have displayed no little ability and power of invective. It long survived the occasion for which it was written, and must have been, in its kind, of some merit, since, personal and local though it was, its celebrity lasted till the Augustan age of Rome. Ovid took it as his model in his satirical poem of the same name.</p>
			<p>The young poet found literary life in Alexandria made impossible for him, and (invited perhaps by sympathisers) he sailed thence to Rhodes. He there produced a revised version of his epic, and was comforted by the applause with which the Rhodians received it. Honoured by all, and presented with the freedom of the city, he gratefully took for his country the land where he was appreciated, and was proud to be known as “Apollonius of Rhodes.” He lived there many years, a renowned poet, and a popular professor of rhetoric. Meanwhile at Alexandria his old enemy died: the old literary cliques were no more: the fame of the prophet who had been without honour in his own country had recrossed the sea: men longed to atone for the neglect which was a discredit to themselves; and Apollonius was given to understand that a warm welcome was prepared for him in the land of his birth. The temptation to triumph on the scene of his humiliation was irresistible. He returned to Egypt: he read his poem to enthusiastic audiences: the opportune death of Eratosthenes, who had succeeded Callimachus as President and Chief Librarian, created a vacancy for which Apollonius was acclaimed the only possible successor. So, installed as the head of the culture and learning of the Greek world, he lived days of peaceful industry and satisfied ambition, till, full of years and honours, he passed away, and, as though to symbolise forgiveness and oblivion of old feuds, was buried beside his old master, Callimachus.</p>
			<p>Like all the Alexandrian scholars, he was busy with his pen to the last. His most important works, besides the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tale of the Argonauts</i>, were the “Foundations,” poems embodying the stories or legends of the origin or foundation of famous cities, such as Rhodes, Cnidus, Alexandria. But of them all only nine and a half lines survive, and it is on the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Argonautica</i> that his fame must rest. The poem is, like the epics of Virgil, Tasso, Tennyson, the work of a student, and not, like those of Homer, the work of a man who had been a part of the life he described. Apollonius connected the Argonauts with all the legends or myths belonging to the places they might be supposed to have visited, gathering materials for this part of his work from the rich libraries in which he wrote. Hence we find traces of his having more matter than he quite knew what to do with; and his digressions on the origins of cities, names, rites, and so forth, are occasionally such as the average reader will skip. Still, all together, they do not occupy proportionally as much space as the similarly little-read Catalogue of the Ships in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i>.</p>
			<p>There can be no doubt that the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Argonautica</i> was for the ancients the one great epic between Homer and Virgil. Even contemporaries wrote commentaries on it. It was popular among the Romans. <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P. T.</abbr> Varro earned fame by his translation of it, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Val.</abbr> Flaccus wrote a Latin Argonautica, which was but a free translation of the Greek original. But his noblest eulogy will be found in the pages of Virgil, who drew no small part of his inspiration from him, transferring to his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Aeneid</i> at least a score of episodes, similes, or picturesque touches.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, Apollonius is very far from being an imitator of Homer. He is, indeed, considering the atmosphere in which his genius was trained, amazingly original; and it is not the least proof of his genius that he recognised that his strength lay in the very things which were either neglected, or lightly touched on, by Homer. The elaborate picturesqueness and unfailing verve with which he describes the coasting voyages, the weird desolation of the Libyan sands, the gauntlet-fight, the battle with the giants, the passage of the Clashing Crags, and that of the Wandering Rocks, the ploughing with the brazen bulls, and many other such incidents, are examples of work of which Homer gives but slight and occasional examples: while the great and crowning achievement of the poem, the story of Medea’s passion, with its fierce fervour, its thrilling pathos, its lovely tenderness and virginal purity, its strangely modern introspectiveness and analysis of motives, is absolutely without parallel, not in Homer alone, but in any Greek poet whose works have come down to us. Even Virgil, with all his human sympathy, with all the advantage of having such a model before him, cannot rise to the same height: the love of Dido is a pale reflex of that of Medea. It is curious, too, to note that, even in the minor matter of similes, Apollonius remains original. In only one (<abbr>Bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 541⁠–⁠548, where he somewhat expands Homer’s thought) can he be charged with imitation.</p>
			<p>The argument has been well summed up by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Prof.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ellis:⁠—“For Apollonius the problem was how to write an epic which should be modelled on the Homeric epics, yet be so completely different as to suggest, not resemblance, but contrast. We think no one who has read even a hundred lines of the poem can fail to be struck by this. It is in fact the reason why it is a success. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Argonautica</i> could not have been written without the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Odyssey</i>, but it is in no sense an echo of either. Nay, we believe that a minute examination of Apollonius’ language and rhythm would show that he placed himself under the most rigid laws of <em>intentional dissimilarity</em>. Not that this is more than one element of his success. His genius is quite as real an element; and no one will deny this who has studied the successive phases of Medea’s passion in Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. If, indeed, greatness could be tested by the extent of influence after death, the poem of Apollonius can rank only with the best works of Greek literature.”</p>
